# Thesis

The files contains all the scripts and WRF namelists used in my MS Thesis, "Numerical Simulation of Wind Flow on Complex Terrain using Mesoscale and Microscale Model Coupling Technique: A Wind Resource Assessment Application."

Some of the codes for the wind data analysis can be found in Wind Energy Analysis repositories outside this folder
